##  What This Research Covers

Network protocols define **how devices communicate** on the internet.  
However, as protocols evolve, so do the **cyber threats that target them**.

This research explores:

| Topic | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| Role of Network Protocols | TCP/IP, HTTP(S), DNS, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, UDP |
| Security Weaknesses | MITM attacks, insecure legacy protocols, SQL injection, DoS, malware, phishing |
| Mitigation Techniques | TLS encryption, VPNs, firewalls, patching, secure coding, user awareness training |
| Human Factor | Vendor & employee exploitation such as Target 2013 breach |

## Key Findings (based on research)

ðŸ“Œ **Finding 1 â€” Legacy protocols remain widely used**  
Even though outdated protocols like Telnet, FTP or older SSL versions expose plaintext data,  
organizations keep them active for **backwards compatibility**, creating preventable risks.

ðŸ“Œ **Finding 2 â€” Humans are the biggest vulnerability**  
Technical defenses fail if attackers succeed in **social engineering**.  
The Target Data Breach (2013) demonstrated how a phishing email allowed attackers to steal  
110 million customer records despite advanced network defenses.

A **layered defense strategy** is essential to keep communication networks safe.
